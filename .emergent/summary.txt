The AI engineer successfully progressed the PNM Gardeners application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initially, the focus was on debugging and enhancing the interactive London map, specifically by correcting the backend's  model to include geographical coordinates and re-seeding the database with accurate data for 39 Checkatrade reviews. Following this, the engineer tackled comprehensive image integration, transitioning from a basic map/gallery to a sophisticated system. This involved extracting all 744 real photos from the user's Google Drive via API integration, developing a service-based photo album gallery, and ensuring accurate display. Concurrently, various UI/UX refinements were requested, such as correcting text, adjusting navigation, and refining review displays, which the engineer is currently addressing.

1.  **Frontend**: Replicate UI/UX, responsive design, and integrate provided logo.
2.  **Content**: Adapt all content for PNM Gardeners.
3.  **Backend**: Full-stack MERN-like (FastAPI, MongoDB) for contact forms and quote requests.
4.  **Notifications**: Send email notifications for form submissions to  with customer confirmations.
5.  **Admin Dashboard**: Page to view all form submissions.
6.  **Navigation**: Ensure CTAs smoothly scroll or activate dialer.
7.  **Real Data**: Fetch services and 39 reviews from .
8.  **New Services**: Add patio, planting, and trellis services.
9.  **Interactive Map**: Display an interactive London map with 39 clickable markers at review postcodes, showing customer feedback and work photos.
10. **Image Gallery**: A dedicated  page displaying all job photos (initially 500+, later specified as 744 from Google Drive) organized into service-based albums, with filters and search.
11. **Refinements**: Update free waste disposal to free disposal of green waste, add FAQ about tools, swap garden clearance and garden maintenance names in the gallery, display only 5 Checkatrade reviews with a view all link, and update experience count from 1000+ to 50+.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React application file, orchestrates routing and component integration.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include  route initially for , then updated to point to . Integrates various main sections and components.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays an interactive Leaflet map with review markers.
    -   **Changes**: Modified extensively to correctly fetch and display 39 reviews with / coordinates. Integrated a new  component for image display upon marker click and created/used  to resolve React-Leaflet popup click issues. Debugged and ensured correct data flow for images.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New component for displaying photos in a full-screen modal with navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Created to display  when View Photos is clicked from map markers or gallery items. Includes thumbnail strip, image counter, and review details. Improved error handling and z-index.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New component designed to display photos grouped by service categories, replacing previous gallery attempts.
    -   **Changes**: Created to show 9 service albums with cover photos and photo counts. Each album is clickable to reveal all photos for that service in a grid layout. This is intended to display the real Google Drive photos.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Navigation bar for the application.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include a dedicated Gallery link that navigates directly to the  page, instead of scrolling to a section, and ensured this change was consistent across desktop and mobile menus.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB document structure.
    -   **Changes**:  model updated to include , , , and  fields to support map and photo gallery functionality. Rating validation adjusted from 1-5 to 1-10.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles MongoDB connection and data seeding.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to seed initial services and reviews (including new ones) into MongoDB with associated geographical coordinates and images. Logic refined to ensure proper database clearing and reseeding to reflect model changes. Adjusted to seed 39 Checkatrade reviews.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New Python script for authenticating with Google Drive API and fetching real photo data.
    -   **Changes**: Developed to connect using a service account JSON key, allowing access to user-provided public Google Drive folders, listing files, and extracting photo URLs for processing.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New script to process real photo data fetched from Google Drive and prepare it for the frontend gallery.
    -   **Changes**: Takes the fetched Google Drive photo URLs and organizes them into a structure (saved to ) suitable for the  component.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the email notification setup by configuring SMTP credentials.
-   Ensure actual Google Drive photos are displayed in the  component, rather than placeholders.
-   Implement the specific text and content updates requested by the user for free disposal of green waste, FAQ about tools, gallery name swaps, Checkatrade review display, and experience count.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in two primary tasks:
1.  **Integrating real Google Drive photos**: After receiving Google Drive API credentials from the user, the engineer successfully used  to fetch a confirmed count of **744 real photos** across 9 service folders. A new  component was created and integrated into  to display these photos in a service-based album structure. However, the user reported that the photos were still not loading, showing placeholders, and the map displayed an incorrect number of jobs (219 instead of 39). The engineer's last action related to this was attempting to create an API endpoint in  to serve the real Google Drive photos to the frontend, indicating that the photos are currently fetched but not yet properly rendered in the UI.
2.  **Addressing multiple UI/content refinements**: The user provided a comprehensive list of specific text and layout changes:
    *   Change free waste disposal to free disposal of green waste.
    *   Add an FAQ entry about tools not needing to be plugged in (except jet wash).
    *   Swap garden clearance and garden maintenance names in the gallery.
    *   Update the reviews section to say Checkatrade reviews, show only 5 actual Checkatrade reviews, and add a clickable view all reviews on Checkatrade box linking to the Checkatrade site.
    *   Update 1000+ reviews and 5+ years experience to 50+ reviews and 1+ year experience.
The engineer acknowledged these requests and stated the intent to make all these updates systematically, starting with the free waste disposal text.

The current state is that the Google Drive photo integration has successfully fetched data but is experiencing frontend display issues, and the engineer has just begun addressing a new set of specific content and UI refinements.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement the first content refinement: changing free waste disposal to free disposal of green waste.
