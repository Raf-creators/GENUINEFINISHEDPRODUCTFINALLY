<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack MERN-like application for PNM Gardeners based on a reference website. Initially, a complete frontend with mock data was developed, replicating the original site's design and structure, including sections for services, reviews, and a contact form. Following user approval, backend integration using FastAPI and MongoDB was implemented, including API endpoints for services, quotes, and reviews. Key additions included a logo, full site navigation, email notifications for form submissions, and an admin dashboard. The most recent focus was on integrating real services and reviews from Checkatrade and implementing an interactive London map with review markers. The engineer debugged issues related to map marker visibility, identifying that review data in the backend lacked geographical coordinates, leading to the current task of correcting the database schema and data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on fixing the interactive London map functionality. The core issue identified was that while reviews were being fetched from the backend, they lacked the necessary geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) that the  component requires to render markers.

The engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Debugging **: Added console logs to inspect the data flowing into the map component, which revealed that  was 0, confirming the absence of coordinate data from the backend.
2.  **Identifying Root Cause**: The backend  model and the seeded data were missing  and  fields, preventing Leaflet from placing markers.
3.  **Correcting Backend Data**: The last explicit action was to fix the backend database to include the coordinates (as per message 187: Let me fix this by updating the backend database to include the coordinates). This implies modifying the  model in  and/or the seeding logic in  to ensure each review object has  and  properties.
4.  **Preparation for Reseed**: The very last message indicates the intent to clear the existing database and restart the backend to reseed with the coordinates, which is the next logical step to apply the data fix.

The current state is that the map component is ready to receive coordinate data, and the backend is being prepared to serve this data correctly.

<optional_next_step>
Clear the database, reseed with correct review coordinates, and restart backend/frontend services to re-test the interactive map.
