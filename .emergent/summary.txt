The AI engineer successfully enhanced the PNM Gardeners application, transitioning from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. Initial efforts focused on comprehensive content updates, including text changes, FAQ additions, and stat adjustments across various frontend components. A significant portion of the work involved debugging and refining the image display, tackling issues with Google Drive photo integration, ensuring real photos load in the gallery and modal, and reorganizing gallery albums based on user-defined categories and image assignments. Key challenges included database synchronization for service images and resolving frontend rendering/caching issues. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, ensuring Checkatrade branding, hero image updates, and gallery performance improvements. The current task involves updating the contact phone number across the application.

The objective is to develop a comprehensive website for PNM Gardeners in Balham, London. This involves replicating UI/UX, ensuring responsiveness, and integrating a custom logo. A full-stack (FastAPI, MongoDB) backend is required for contact and quote forms, with email notifications to  and customer confirmations. An admin dashboard is needed for form submissions. Navigation must include smooth CTA scrolls/dialer activation. The site requires integration of 39 real reviews from  and the addition of patio, planting, and trellis services. A key feature is an interactive London map with 39 clickable review markers showing feedback and work photos. A dedicated  page must display 744 real job photos from Google Drive, organized into service-based albums with filters/search. Refinements include changing free waste disposal to free disposal of green waste, adding an FAQ about tools, swapping garden clearance and garden maintenance names in the gallery, displaying only 5 Checkatrade reviews with a view all link, and updating experience count from 1000+ to 50+.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on updating the phone number across the application. This followed a series of successful, complex updates. The most recent completed tasks involved a comprehensive reorganization of the photo gallery, where albums were reordered, photos reassigned between categories (e.g., Hedge Trimming photos to Pruning), empty albums removed, and a new Garden Maintenance album populated with 15 user-provided photos from a specific Google Drive folder. Crucially, the engineer also fixed a persistent issue with the photo modal: images now display correctly when clicked within the gallery, and performance lag due to large image loading has been addressed with lazy loading. The application now displays 759 real photos across 9 precisely organized service albums, all with correct cover images and descriptions. The hero section, reviews, and services sections also display all user-provided images and content updates, including Checkatrade branding. The current task is to update the phone number from  to  across all relevant frontend components. The engineer has identified instances of the old number and is in the process of replacing them.
