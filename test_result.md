# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##

##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Email templates contain correct phone number (07748 853590) and business email. HTML formatting is correct with professional styling. Error handling works properly - API continues to function even if email delivery fails. All 39 backend tests passed (100% success rate).

Real Google Drive integration confirmed - photos load from drive.google.com URLs with proper fallback handling. Navigation between album list and individual album views works correctly. Minor issue: Google Drive images blocked by CORS in testing environment (expected), but fallback images display properly. All core gallery functionality working as expected."

### CONTENT UPDATES COMPLETED ✓

**All Content Updates Successfully Completed:**

1. ✅ **"Free waste disposal" → "Free disposal of green waste"**
   - Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/WhyChooseUs.jsx` line 30
   - Updated `/app/frontend/src/mock/data.js` line 174

2. ✅ **Added FAQ about tools not needing power**
   - Added new FAQ entry (id: 7) in `/app/frontend/src/mock/data.js`
   - Content: "Do I need to provide power for your tools? No, you don't need to provide power for our tools. We come fully equipped with battery-powered and petrol-powered equipment, so no mains electricity is required. The only exception is our jet wash, which may need access to a power outlet in some cases."

3. ✅ **Swapped "Garden Clearance" and "Maintenance" names in gallery**
   - Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/ServicePhotoAlbums.jsx`
   - "Garden Clearance" section now shows maintenance content
   - "Maintenance" section now shows clearance content

4. ✅ **Updated Reviews Section to Checkatrade**
   - Changed header from "Google Reviews" to "Checkatrade Reviews"  
   - Limited display to 5 reviews maximum
   - Added "View All Reviews on Checkatrade" button linking to checkatrade.com/trades/pnmgardening
   - Updated base count to "50+ Checkatrade reviews"

5. ✅ **Updated Experience Stats from "1000+ reviews and 5+ years" to "50+ reviews and 1+ year"**
   - Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/HeroSection.jsx`: "1000+" → "50+", "5+" → "1+"
   - Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/ContactSection.jsx`: "1000+ satisfied customers" → "50+ satisfied customers", "5+ years serving Balham" → "1+ year serving Balham"
   - Updated `/app/frontend/src/components/WhyChooseUs.jsx`: "1000+" → "50+", "5+" → "1+"

**All requested content updates have been successfully implemented.** The application now reflects the corrected statistics, updated FAQ, proper service name swapping, and Checkatrade branding as requested.
